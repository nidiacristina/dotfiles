;; Keybindings.  This file is grouped into two pieces: 1) global key bindings
;; and 2) mode-specific bindings.

;; =============================== Development ===============================
;;
;;    M-k           Compile the current buffer and view the output.
;;     %            Jump to matching parenthesis/bracket/brace.
;;    C-c o         Open a buffer containing all lines matching a search.
;;    M-i           Read a man page.
;;    M-.           Jump to a symbol's definition.
;;    M-,           Search for all symbols containing the specified search.
;;    M-*           Pop the marker stack.
;;

;; compile the current buffer and have the compilation's output in another
;; window.
(global-set-key (kbd "M-k") 'compile)

;; mimic vi's parentheses matching behavior.
(global-set-key (kbd "%") 'find-matching-paren)

;; open another buffer with hyperlinks to every line that matches the user
;; specified search term.
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c o") 'occur)

;; read a man page, defaulting to the symbol under the point.
(global-set-key (kbd "M-i") 'man)

;; the xref package is the way of the future so use our interactive shim to
;; maintain the legacy etags interace's behavior of prompting for a symbol.
;; if the package isn't available, then the key is already bound to what we
;; want.
(if (fboundp 'interactive-xref-find-definitions)
      (progn (global-set-key (kbd "M-.") 'interactive-xref-find-definitions)

;; ============================= Formatting ==================================
;;
;; Let us worry about getting ideas into the computer quickly and then have
;; Emacs make them look nice.
;;
;;     C-x M-f      Fill the current region.
;;     C-x M-q      Align the current region.
;;

;; wrap the text in the current region.
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x M-f") 'fill-region)

;; align the current text (e.g. variable assignments aligned about a "=")
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x M-q") 'align)

;; =========================== Buffer Management =============================
;;
;; Make it easy to get to the buffer we're interested in.
;;
;;    C-o           Switch to this window's other-buffer.
;;    C-x M-b       Bury this window's buffer.
;;

;; switch to this window's other buffer.

;; send this buffer to the end of the list.
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x M-b") 'bury-buffer)

;; ======================= Window and Frame Navigation ======================
;;
;; Provide single key movement through windows/frames using the "o" and "p"
;; keys.
;;
;;    M-o           Activate next window
;;    M-p           Activate previous window
;;    C-M-o         Activate next frame
;;    C-M-p         Activate previous frame
;;

;; make the next/previous window active.

;; ============================ Buffer Navigation ============================
;;
;; Moving through a buffer.
;;
;;    M-g           Jump to a specific line.
;;    mouse-5       Scroll the buffer up half a page.
;;    mouse-4       Scroll the buffer down half a page.
;;

;; move to a line by line number.

  (global-set-key (kbd "<mouse-4>") 'scroll-down-half-page))

;; ============================= Miscellaneous ===============================
;;
;; Grab bag of bindings.  Prevent graphical Emacs from iconifying itself or
;; terminal Emacs from suspending itself.  Prevent an errant key press from
;; exiting the application if there aren't any modified buffers.
;;
;;    C-z           Unbound.
;;    C-x C-z       Unbound.
;;    C-x C-c       Quitting Emacs asks to save buffers first.
;;

;; never iconify or suspend a frame.

;;
;;    M-N           Next hunk.
;;    M-P           Previous hunk.

;; diff-mode is a bit zealous in mapping its functionality to keys.  several of
;; the movement functions (diff-file-next/prev, diff-hunk-next/prev) are mapped
;; multiple times and mask global bindings we have set above.  this ensures
;; diff-mode behaves consistently relative to other modes.

;; ============================== Comint Mode ================================
;;

;;       the GUD (GDB's shell and I/O), shells, etc.
